# Course design

Updated: 2026-10-07. This is a discovery document, not an approved implementation specification.

## Confirmed intent

Source for C-001 through C-005: the owner's initiating request on 2026-10-07 in the planning conversation. The request described forgetting material after reading and exercises, asked for repeated practice until the learner feels it is learned, and explicitly deferred implementation until discussion and a documented plan.

| ID | Confirmed requirement |
|---|---|
| C-001 | Design a Spanish-learning course, using JavaScript Learning Lab as a reference for the project approach. |
| C-002 | Repeatedly revisit previously studied material; finishing initial reading or exercises must not end access to practice. |
| C-003 | Account for the learner's own judgment of whether material has been learned. The interaction and mastery criteria are still open. |
| C-004 | Develop the design collaboratively through proposals, questions, and answers; agree on documentation and a plan before implementation. |
| C-005 | Create a public repository and a project directory in the maintainer's Startups area. |

Source for C-006 through C-013: the owner's follow-up on 2026-10-07 specifying foundations, selectable practice, hints, tense confusion, personally useful expressions, and the exclusion of conversation. Personal proficiency estimates and learning records are not published here.

| ID | Confirmed requirement |
|---|---|
| C-006 | Start the course from beginner foundations even for a returning learner. The final target level remains open. |
| C-007 | Allow practice-only sessions with no obligation to study new material. The learner can choose a topic directly and identify topics previously studied outside the course. |
| C-008 | A selected topic provides a rule refresher and continued varied written practice: translation, writing sentences, and selecting correct answers. |
| C-009 | Use errors and requests for hints as evidence for more practice of the relevant skill, including targeted recommendations and its appearance in later sentences. The attribution and scheduling design remain open. |
| C-010 | Address regular conjugation, exceptions, and confusion between tenses, including the distinction between forming a tense and choosing when to use it. |
| C-011 | Support repeated practice of personally useful words and recurring expressions, even when they are not globally frequent. Capture and validation workflows remain to be designed. |
| C-012 | Conversation and speaking practice are out of scope. Do not design a separate future conversation course. Listening-only exercises have not been decided. |
| C-013 | Evaluate deterministic operation and possible AI assistance before selecting an architecture. Neither AI nor paid API use is approved. |

## Initial proposals — not approved unless reflected in confirmed requirements

These are product ideas, not empirical claims about learning effectiveness or settled requirements.

| ID | Proposal | Example or unresolved detail |
|---|---|---|
| P-001 | Offer separate entry points for course study, selected-topic practice, and recommended review. | New material is optional under C-007; session length and balance remain open. |
| P-002 | Track specific skills separately from lesson completion. | Recognizing a word, recalling it without hints, and using it in a sentence could have separate evidence. |
| P-003 | Return to the same skill through varied written prompts. | Translation, sentence completion, independent writing, and multiple choice are in scope under C-008. Conversation is excluded. |
| P-004 | Offer an explicit repeat-more control for troublesome material. | The learner can keep a skill in frequent practice even after correct answers. |
| P-005 | Use spaced follow-up checks after successful practice. | Intervals, failure behavior, and what happens after the learner marks something learned are undecided. No permanent-retention guarantee. |
| P-006 | Keep review manageable after missed days. | Explore a session limit, prioritization, and optional extra practice rather than mandatory completion of an unlimited backlog. |
| P-007 | Use skill-specific hints and separate evidence for independent, hinted, and revealed answers. | A vocabulary hint must not automatically mark the whole grammar topic weak. Ambiguous errors need a focused follow-up rather than a confident diagnosis. |
| P-008 | Alternate focused drills with optional contrast exercises across already studied tenses. | Forming a tense when its name is supplied differs from choosing it in context. Unstudied grammar should not silently enter a selected practice session. |
| P-009 | Maintain a private personal phrase collection with an explicit add action. | Save intended meaning, a checked Spanish expression, and relevant context; practice both the phrase and variations of its reusable construction. Do not turn an unchecked attempt into a memorization target. |
| P-010 | Explore a deterministic core with optional AI assistance for open-ended writing. | Fixed-answer checking and scheduling can be specified without a model. AI could propose feedback, phrase candidates, or exercise variants, subject to evaluation; uncertain judgments should not automatically lower mastery. |

## Proposed evidence behavior

These are design candidates, not implemented or approved rules:

- Correct without help: evidence for that assessed skill and task type; later independent checks still matter.
- Correct after a targeted hint: assisted evidence for the hinted skill, not identical to independent recall.
- Full answer revealed: a learning opportunity, not a passed recall check.
- An incorrect form in an otherwise correct sentence: assess the target locally; do not penalize every skill in the sentence.
- Ambiguous free-text answer: allow valid alternatives, explicit uncertainty, and a correction/review path; never equate failure to match one reference string with a proven language error.
- Previously studied topic: eligible for practice, not automatically mastered.

Illustrative grammar reference: pretérito perfecto compuesto uses present-tense haber plus a participle; regular participles include -ado and -ido, with irregular forms such as hecho and dicho. This terminology was checked against [RAE conjugation tables](https://www.rae.es/buen-uso-espa%C3%B1ol/conjugaci%C3%B3n-espa%C3%B1ola) on 2026-10-07. These are synthetic curriculum examples, not learner performance records.

Illustrative skill: choosing between ser and estar. A possible sequence is a short explanation, a guided exercise, independent production, and later use in a different situation. This does not establish the learner's level or actual difficulties.

## Discussion sequence

1. Resolve how personal phrases enter the course: user-provided Spanish, a phrase written in the explanation language, selected lesson examples, or a combination. This informs the AI discussion without choosing a provider or model.
2. Discuss how focused practice and mixed review should interact, and what "I have learned this" should change.
3. Define target level, practical situations, Spanish variety, explanation/UI languages, and treatment of familiar foundations.
4. Define session duration, device, and whether listening-only exercises belong in scope. Speaking remains excluded.
5. Resolve feedback, valid answer variants, hint attribution, uncertainty, missed days, storage, and any AI cost/privacy constraints.
6. Agree on curriculum, sample lesson and review flows, acceptance criteria, and implementation scope.

Discuss a small number of questions per turn. Answers may change the sequence. Do not treat suggested options as decisions.

## Open boundaries

Target level and handling familiar foundations; Spanish variety; explanation/UI languages; desktop/mobile; session duration; listening-only exercises; source and rights of learning content; use alongside a teacher; progress storage and privacy; offline needs; AI/API usage and cost; accessibility; license; hosting; technology; review algorithm and mastery criteria. Beginner foundations and exclusion of conversation/speaking are settled.

## Reference inspected

On 2026-10-07, the existing JavaScript Learning Lab docs/REQUIREMENTS.md was read locally. REQ-007 calls for delayed review; REQ-033 distinguishes lesson states from understanding evidence. These are design references only and are not automatically adopted here. No claim is made about the current implementation satisfying those requirements.
